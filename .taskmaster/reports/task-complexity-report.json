			"taskTitle": "Set Up JSON Server API using existing db.json",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into two subtasks. The first subtask should cover installing `json-server` and adding the `api` script to `package.json`. The second subtask should focus on creating the `src/lib/config.ts` file to export the `API_BASE_URL`, ensuring it uses environment variables with a fallback, and adding a corresponding `.env.example` file.",
			"reasoning": "This task is primarily about project setup and configuration. Codebase analysis shows `json-server` is not installed and no API configuration exists. It involves installing one dev dependency, adding one npm script, and creating one new configuration file. There are no existing API clients to refactor, making this a simple, greenfield setup task."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Pagination and Responsive Card View for Users",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. First, update the `useUsers` hook to parse the `X-Total-Count` header and return it. Second, add page state to the `UsersPage` and integrate the Shadcn `Pagination` component. Third, create the reusable `UserCard.tsx` component. Fourth, implement the responsive layout on the `UsersPage` to show the `DataTable` on `md` screens and up, and a grid of `UserCard`s on smaller screens. Finally, refine the desktop table columns for better readability.",
			"reasoning": "This task has two distinct parts: implementing pagination and creating a responsive card view. The pagination part requires modifying the core `useUsers` hook to support `X-Total-Count`, adding page state, and wiring up the UI. The responsive view part involves creating a new `UserCard.tsx` component and using Tailwind CSS to conditionally render either the full data table or a grid of cards based on screen size. The combination of these two features makes it moderately complex."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop and Integrate Metric Cards on Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. First, create the basic `MetricCard.tsx` component structure using Shadcn's Card. Second, add the conditional styling for the change percentage. Third, create the `MetricCardSkeleton.tsx` component. Fourth, on the `Dashboard.tsx` page, call the `useMetrics` hook. Finally, implement the rendering logic on the dashboard to show skeletons, an error message, or the grid of `MetricCard` components based on the hook's state.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a reusable presentational component (`MetricCard`), its skeleton state, and integrating them into the Dashboard page using the `useMetrics` hook. Codebase analysis confirms that `shadcn/ui` Card components are available, which significantly reduces implementation effort. The logic for conditional styling and handling loading/error/success states is a standard, well-defined pattern for a React Query-based application."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build the User Data Table Structure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. First, define the table columns in `src/components/users/columns.tsx` using `ColumnDef<User>`. Second, build the generic `data-table.tsx` component using `useReactTable` and Shadcn's Table components. Third, create a `data-table-skeleton.tsx` for the loading state. Fourth, integrate the table on the Users page, fetching data with `useUsers`. Finally, implement the custom cell renderers for columns like avatar, status, and dates.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex as it introduces a major new dependency, `@tanstack/react-table`, which is not yet in the project. It requires significant greenfield development, including creating multiple interconnected files for columns, a generic data table component, and a skeleton loader. The setup requires a deep understanding of the table library's hooks and concepts (`ColumnDef`, `useReactTable`), and custom cell rendering adds another layer of implementation detail."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Analytics Page with 2x2 Chart Grid",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. Create four separate, reusable chart components in `src/components/charts/`: a Line, Bar, Donut, and Area chart, each accepting data and loading state props. Then, on the `AnalyticsPage`, fetch data using the `useAnalytics` hook and create the 2x2 responsive grid layout. Finally, integrate the chart components into the grid, wrapping each with `React.lazy` and a `Suspense` boundary that shows a skeleton loader.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves building an entire page with multiple complex visualizations and introducing the `recharts` library. It requires creating four distinct and reusable chart components, each needing correct configuration with the Recharts API. The complexity is increased by the need to compose them into a responsive 2x2 grid and implement performance optimizations like lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`, which adds structural overhead."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Date Range Filters and Data Export to Analytics",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. First, add the UI controls (Tabs, Date Picker, Export Dropdown) to the Analytics page using existing Shadcn components. Second, implement the state management for the date range and create a memoized, filtered dataset. Third, wire up the UI controls to update this state. Fourth, create the data export utilities in `src/lib/exportUtils.ts`. Finally, connect the export dropdown to these utilities, passing the currently filtered data.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces significant client-side logic and complex UI composition. The date range filtering requires careful state management and memoization (`useMemo`) to avoid performance issues. Building a custom date picker from Shadcn's `Popover` and `Calendar` components is non-trivial. Furthermore, creating generic utility functions for CSV/JSON export in a new `exportUtils.ts` file and wiring them up adds another distinct dimension of complexity to the page."

			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure App-wide Accessibility and Final Polish",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. First, audit all interactive elements (especially icon buttons) and add accessible names (`aria-label`). Second and third, implement placeholder 'Edit' and 'Delete' modals on the users table using Shadcn's Dialog/AlertDialog. Fourth, specifically test and verify keyboard navigation and focus management for these new modals. Finally, conduct a full review of the Dashboard, Analytics, and Users pages to ensure loading, error, and empty states are handled consistently.",
			"reasoning": "This is a cross-cutting concern. Its complexity comes from the breadth of the audit across multiple components rather than a single difficult algorithm. The primary work involves implementing accessible modals for user actions (simplified by `shadcn/ui`'s built-in focus trapping), adding ARIA attributes where needed, and ensuring consistent state handling. While no single part is extremely difficult, the systematic review and attention to detail required across the app give it moderate complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Hooks and TypeScript Types",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into detailed subtasks. Start with defining the TypeScript interfaces in a new `src/types/index.ts` file. Then, install and configure the React Query client and provider in `main.tsx`. Follow with creating the three custom hooks (`useUsers`, `useMetrics`, `useAnalytics`) in a new `src/api/hooks.ts` file, paying special attention to the parameterization and dynamic query key generation for the `useUsers` hook.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and involves significant greenfield development. Codebase analysis shows no existing data-fetching layer or types. It requires installing and configuring `@tanstack/react-query`, creating new `types` and `api` directories, and implementing three distinct data-fetching hooks. The `useUsers` hook's complexity, with its support for dynamic filtering, sorting, and pagination parameters, elevates this beyond a simple setup task."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add Search, Filter, and Sort to Users Table",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. First, centralize state management for all filter, search, and sort parameters in the main `UsersPage` component, including a debounced search term. Second, create a `UsersTableToolbar` component with a search input and filter dropdowns, controlled by props from the page. Third, modify the table column headers to be clickable buttons that update the sort state. Finally, ensure all state changes correctly update the parameters passed to the `useUsers` hook, triggering a data refetch.",
			"reasoning": "This task adds a significant layer of interactivity and state management to the users table. It involves coordinating state from multiple sources (search, filters, sorting), implementing a debounced search to avoid excessive API calls, and creating a toolbar with multiple controls. The interaction between the page, the toolbar, and the table component is complex and requires careful state management to ensure all features work together seamlessly, making it one of the most complex tasks."
