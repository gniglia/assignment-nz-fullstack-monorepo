globs:

You are an expert full-stack developer proficient in TypeScript, React, Vite, and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI). Your task is to produce the most optimized and maintainable code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture.

Objective

- Create a Vite + React solution that is not only functional but also adheres to the best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.

Code Style and Structure

- Never try to start the app itself (I have it running in a separate terminal).
- Use `npx shadcn add` to add new shadcn components.
- Use double quote over single quote for imports and strings.
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes/OOP.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components over default.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
- Add a space before a function declaration's parentheses.
- Always use === instead of ==.
- Infix operators must be spaced.
- Always handle the err function parameter.

Naming Conventions

- **Component Files**: Use PascalCase for component file names (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`, `DataTable.tsx`).
- **Component Names**: Use PascalCase for component function names (e.g., `function UserProfile()`, `function DataTable()`).
- **Component Props**: Use PascalCase for prop type names (e.g., `UserProfileProps`, `DataTableProps`).
- **Custom Hooks**: Use camelCase starting with "use" (e.g., `useUserData`, `useLocalStorage`). **Hook Files**: Use camelCase for hook file names (e.g., `useApi.ts`, `useDebounce.ts`, `useUsersIntegration.ts`).
- **Utility Functions**: Use camelCase for utility functions (e.g., `formatDate`, `validateEmail`).
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`, `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`).
- **Type Definitions**: Use PascalCase for type names (e.g., `User`, `ApiResponse`, `FormData`).
- **Event Handlers**: Use camelCase with descriptive names (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `onUserSelect`).
- **Boolean Variables**: Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canEdit`).
- **Array Variables**: Use plural nouns (e.g., `users`, `items`, `errors`).
- **Object Variables**: Use singular nouns (e.g., `user`, `item`, `error`).

JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer types over interfaces. Avoid enums, use maps.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

React

- Use functional components and TypeScript types.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- **NEVER use inline arrow functions in JSX** (e.g., `onClick={() => setState(value)}`). Always create stable function references with `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor RSC.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
- Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.
- Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
- Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
- Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
- Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
- Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
- Use useMemo for expensive computations.
- Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
- Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting.
- Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
- Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
- Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.

Forms and Validation

- Use controlled components for form inputs.
- Implement form validation (client-side and server-side).
- Consider using libraries like react-hook-form for complex forms.
- Use Zod for schema validation.

Package Management

- **ALWAYS use pnpm** for all package management operations (install, add, remove, etc.)
- Never use npm or yarn commands - always use pnpm equivalents
- Use `pnpm install` for installing dependencies
- Use `pnpm add <package>` for adding new packages
- Use `pnpm remove <package>` for removing packages
- Use `pnpm run <script>` for running package.json scripts

Key Conventions

1. **ALWAYS use pnpm** for package management.
2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
   - Prefer server components.
   - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.
   - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.

State Management and Data Fetching

- Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
- Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.

Security and Performance

- Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.
- Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.

Testing and Documentation

- Write unit tests for components using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.

Methodology

1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

Process

1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.

Refer to official documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices.
